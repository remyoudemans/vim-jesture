INTRODUCTION                                    *jesture*

This plugin addresses a few repetitive tasks in Jest:
 - alternating between mocks/tests and the files they mock/test
 - toggling assertions between `it` and `it.only`
 - mocking imports.

MAPPINGS                                        *jesture-mappings*

IMPORTANT: All mappings start with `<leader>j`. All of the following mapping
descriptions omit it. Read every mapping as: `<leader>j{mapping}`.

                                                *jesture-alternation-mappings*
Alternation mappings~

                                                *jesture_at*
at                      Alternate between `filename.*` and `filename.test.*`
                        or (if you already have a `__tests__` folder)
                        `__tests__/filename.test.*`.
                        
                                                *jesture_vt*
vt                      Like `at` but opens in a vertical split.
                        
                                                *jesture_ht*
ht                      Like `at` but opens in a horizontal split.

                                                *jesture_am*
am                      Alternate between `filename.*` and `__mocks__/filename.*`
                        (and optionally create `__mocks__` directory if it doesn't
                        exist).

                                                *jesture_vm*
vm                      Like `am` but opens in a vertical split.
                        
                                                *jesture_hm*
hm                      Like `am` but opens in a horizontal split.
                        
                                                *jesture-only-mappings*
Only mappings~

                                                *jesture_to*
to                      Toggle current assertion between `it` and `it.only`.

                                                *jesture_oo*
oo                      Like `to` but also removes all other
                        `only`s in buffer if it is toggling `only` on (making
                        the assertion the Only Only).

                                                *jesture_ro*
ro                      Makes all `it.only` assertions simple `it` assertions
                        (Removing Onlies).

                                                *jesture-mocking-import-mappings*
Mocking import mappings~

                                                *jesture_mi*
mi                      Mock import of current line in the next line.

                        Example:
                        Using `<leader>jmi` on either of the following lines

                        `const example = require('../utils/example')`
                        `import example from '../utils/example'`

                        produces this on the next line

                        `jest.mock('../utils/example')`
